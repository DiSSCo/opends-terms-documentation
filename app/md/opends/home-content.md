Open Digital Specimen (openDS) is a comprehensive data specification that describes the essence of a "Digital Specimen" as implemented by [DiSSCo](https://www.dissco.eu/), a digital surrogate of a specimen on the internet with its related information. 
The openDS data model documented here is based on the draft [GBIF Unified Model](https://www.gbif.org/composition/HjlTr705BctcnaZkcjRJq/gbif-new-data-model) as well as biodiversity information standards like [Darwin Core](https://www.tdwg.org/standards/) and [ABCD](https://www.tdwg.org/standards/abcd/). 
openDS is designed to enhance [FAIR aspects](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) of specimen data including support for provenance data and machine actionability.  
For each digital object we created a terms, guide and resources page.
In the top right you will find a navigation bar where there are dropdowns for each type of documentation we provide.
